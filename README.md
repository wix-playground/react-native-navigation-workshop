# react-native-navigation workshop

## Intro
The aim of the workshop is to provide you with the basic knowledge and tools required to start working with `react-native-navigation@v2`.

In this workshop you will build an app which uses V2 to familiarize your self with the RNN's API.
The app contains 4 tabs, each focusing on a key element of RNN:
* Tab 1 - Layouts
  * setRoot with stack
  * setRoot with bottomTabs
  * setRoot with sideMenu
* Tab 2 - Commands
  * push screen
  * pop screen
  * showModal
  * dismissModal
* Tab 3 - Basic styling
* Tab 4 - Static events
  * componentDidAppear
  * componentDidDisappear

In order to focus on working with RNNv2, All views are implemented for you and you only need to add the Navigation api according to the instruction in the code.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and run the project. Everything has already been setup for you.
```
npm install && npm run start
react-native run-ios
```

## Let's get to work
Look for all the TODO's in the code and implement the missing functionality according to the instruction in code.
